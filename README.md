# The_Legend_Of_Balonga
This is a project started in 2015 for a school project with the intention of getting familiar with C and compete in the school's game fair.

 It is a turn-based text RPG in C using multiple option choices that impact how the story unravels.
 
 The (...)_Battle_C version is full of bugs and is unfinished. Keep in mind that most of the lenghty code could be eliminated by using more methods and functions instead of repeated lines.

# Reopened the project on a new file (...)_Final using better practices and code in general.

The new file does not include a story, there are only the basic mechanics laid out for further development of the project.
