# The_Legend_Of_Balonga
This is a project started in 2015 for a school project with the intention of getting familiar with C and compete in the school's game fair.

 It is a turn-based text RPG in C using multiple option choices that impact how the story unravels.
 
 The current version is full of bugs and is unfinished. Keep in mind that most of the lenghty code could be eliminated by using more methods and functions instead of repeated lines.
